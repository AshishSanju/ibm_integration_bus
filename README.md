`ibm_integration_bus` Cookbook
==========================
[IBM® Integration Bus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/integration-bus/), formerly known as WebSphere® Message Broker, is an enterprise service bus (ESB) providing connectivity and universal data transformation for service-oriented architecture (SOA) and non-SOA environments. Businesses of any size can eliminate point-to-point connections and batch processing regardless of platform, protocol, or data format.


You can find more information about using IBM Integration Bus from the [IBM Integration Bus Version 9.0 Information Center](http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v9r0m0/index.jsp).


Use this cookbook to install and configure all the components that you need to start developing applications with [IBM Integration Bus](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/integration-bus/), including:


* IBM Integration Bus runtime component
* IBM Integration Bus Toolkit
* IBM Integration Bus Explorer  
* All product prerequisites, including WebSphere MQ Version 7.5.0.1  

The cookbook also creates a user account to manage the components, and 
creates and configures all the components that are required for a running  Integration Bus instance.

For answers to questions about this cookbook see the provided [FAQ](./FAQ.md).

Usage
-----
Include `ibm_integration_bus` in your node's `run_list` to install and set up all IBM Integration Bus components. The `package_site_url` attribute must be set to the location of the downloaded Developer Edition installation package. [Download](https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/signup.do?source=swg-wmbfd&S_TACT=109KA7GW&S_CMP=web_opp_ibm_ws_appint_integrationbus&lang=en_US&S_PKG=dk) this package and put it onto an FTP or HTTP site that is accessible by the chef client running the recipes. The `package_site_url` points to the directory containing the install package and the full URL is generated by appending `package_site_url` and `package_name` together. For example: if `package_site_url` is `ftp://company_ftp_site.com/iib_packages` and  `package_name` is left to the default value of `9.0.0-IIB-LINUXX64-DEVELOPER.tar.gz` then the URL used is `ftp://company_ftp_site.com/iib_packages/9.0.0-IIB-LINUXX64-DEVELOPER.tar.gz`.
